## What the script can do
* Sort all references in increasing order
* Correctly recognize multireferences like `[1, 2]`
* Correctly recognize repeating references
* Stop working if unused references are found
## What the script **can not** do
* Work with ".doc" format
* **Recognize references in lists and tables**
* Work with unused references
* recognize more than 8 references in a row. Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

> *I have not tested this script on Windows, so I donâ€™t know how it will work on it.*
